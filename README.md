# 620FinalProject
Final Project for my Web Design Class (SW-DEV-620)

Everything in this repository is set up for my final project.

Starting with the Main Page, you will find links to all other pages and this acts as the introduction to the webpage. The Class Discussion Pages goes into detail about the basics
of how the Shaman Class works. The Talents Page introduces all the talents and the tooltip functionality. The BiS List introduces Javascript (with two text fields & a button sending
data). This data at the current moment only sends to the table below and acts as a template. Taking the extra step, I would gain access to the WoW API and get access to the 
gear the character inputted is wearing and would be placed in the table. Right now, the template just acts like that - a template.
