# 620FinalProject
Final Project for my Web Design Class (SW-DEV-620)

Everything in this repository is set up for my final project.

Starting with the Main Page, you will find links to all other pages and this acts as the introduction to the webpage. The Class Discussion Pages goes into detail about the basics
of how the Shaman Class works. The Talents Page introduces all the talents and the tooltip functionality. The BiS List introduces Javascript (with two text fields & a button sending
data). This data at the current moment only sends to the table below and acts as a template. Taking the extra step, I would gain access to the WoW API and get access to the 
gear the character inputted is wearing and would be placed in the table. Right now, the template just acts like that - a template.

I also have an external css sheet being used for all the formatting.


Things used from class on this project:
HTML Practices (things such as tables, images, embedding)
CSS Practices (External Style Sheet with multiple different styling details)
Javascript Practices (Scripting function in place)
Explored doing some database things for the website - but did not have current access to the WoW API to move further.



TESTING COMPLETED:
I ran the website on my PC, my laptop, and my work laptop. I also ran on Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. Also gave my mom the Git Repo and made sure it worked for her. All tests ran successfully.
